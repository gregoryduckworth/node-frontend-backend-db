# Auth Feature

This folder contains all authentication-related logic for the frontend application. It includes:

- **API calls** for user registration, login, logout, and token refresh
- **State management** for authentication status and user info
- **Types** for authentication requests and responses
- **Helpers** for handling authentication flows

Typical usage:

- Import and use the exported hooks and API functions in your pages/components to manage user authentication.
- Handles token storage, user session, and error handling.
